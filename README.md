# 📬 MailMind – Your AI-Powered Gmail Summarizer & Life Organizer

MailMind is a personal **multimodal AI assistant** that reads your Gmail inbox, summarizes important emails, extracts tasks & deadlines, and helps you stay productive — all powered by **Gemini 1.5 Flash** and the **Agno Agent SDK**.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Gmail Summarization**  
Uses Google's Gemini API to summarize the most recent emails and extract only what matters.

✅ **Task & Deadline Extraction**  
Parses out tasks, meetings, or reminders from your messages to help you stay on top of things.

✅ **Agent-Based Design (Agno SDK)**  
Each AI agent has a role: summarizer, extractor, scheduler, recommender (planned).

✅ **Modular & Scalable**  
Easily expandable with calendar sync, voice interface, productivity suggestions, and more.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Authenticates with Gmail and fetches the latest messages  
2. Feeds the content to a Gemini-powered agent using Agno SDK  
3. Agent extracts tasks, summaries, or routines from the messages  
4. Future expansion includes calendar updates, habit reminders, and personalized advice
